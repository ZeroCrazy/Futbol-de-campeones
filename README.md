> FDC (Soccer of Champions) was a semi-personal project with a partner, but it was left due to lack of time. Our intention was to go to soccer fields and offer players to have them on our page so that they could create their own leagues and divisions, with their own statistics for each player, goals per season, etc...

### Features

- Creation and edition of both players and administrators and facilities (soccer fields)
- Real-time management of a football match
- Complete system of soccer teams, players, seasons, leagues and divisions
- The entire system was developed in PHP 5.6 when PHP 7.0 had not yet been released
